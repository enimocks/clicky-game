This game shows twelve characters from the TV show "Futurama" in a grid, and begins when you click on one of the character tiles. After your first click, the tiles will all shuffle randomly, and your goal is to then click on a _different_ character, continuing in this manner until you have clicked all twelve unique characters **once and only once**. If you are able to click all twelve characters only one time, you win the game and have an awesome memory! Good luck!
